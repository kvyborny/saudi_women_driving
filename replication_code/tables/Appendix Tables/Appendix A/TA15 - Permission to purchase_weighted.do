Purpose: 		APPENDIX TABLE - Ability to spend without permission; unweighted,
								 weighted by BL age-edu, and weighted by BL 
								 employment status
			
Table footnotes: The outcome was constructed as follows: respondents were asked 
to rate their level of agreement (on a 5 point Likert scale) with the statement: 
"I can make a purchase of 1000 SAR without needing to take permission from any 
member of my family" (1000 SAR is roughly equivalent to 265 USD, in 2021 dollars). 
Responses were transformed into a binary indicator for above median response. In 
Columns 2 and 3 we re-estimate our results using survey weights to map to population 
estimates of education according to age group (Column 2), and labor force 
participation (Column 3). We generate these weights as described in Table A11. 
Variations in sample size are due to drop-off from telephone survey; order of 
survey modules was randomized. All estimates include individual and household 
controls: age (above median dummy), education level (less than a high school degree),
marital status (indicators for married, never-married, and widowed), household size 
(number of members), number of cars owned (indicators for one car and for more than 
one car), an indicator for baseline labor force participation, and strata fixed 
effects. SEs are clustered at household level. We replace missing control values 
with 0 and include missing dummies for each. * p < 0.1 ** p < 0.05 *** p < 0.01.
