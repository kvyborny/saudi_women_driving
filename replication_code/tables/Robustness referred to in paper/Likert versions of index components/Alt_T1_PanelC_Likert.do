Purpose: 		Robustness	-	Table 1, Panel C; Ability to leave the house, 
								Ability to make purchases, Attitudes towards women 
								working (female and male social networks); Likert
								versions




Table footnotes: This table is an alternate version of Table 1 Panel C in the paper,
where we use the full likert scale to generate the index outcome. In Columns 
1 and 2, respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement (on a 5 point 
Likert scale) with the following statements: "If I wanted to meet with a friend 
outside of my home, I could do so without seeking approval / permission from anyone 
in my household first" and "I can make a purchase of 1000 SAR without needing to 
take permission from any member of my family" (1000 SAR is roughly equivalent to 
265 USD, in 2021 dollars), respectively. In Columns 3 and 4, respondents 
were asked to think about a group and report what share of that group (`none`, 
`a minority', `about half', `a majority', or `all') they think would `somewhat' 
or `completely' agree with the following statements: `Women can be equally good 
business executives', `It's ok for a woman to have priorities outside the home', 
and `Children are OK if a mother works'. Second order beliefs questions are indexed 
for one female reference group (female community members) in Column 3 and two male 
reference groups: male family members and male community members in Column 4. 
Variations in sample size are due to drop-off 
from telephone survey; order of survey modules was randomized. All estimates 
include individual and household controls: age (above median dummy), education 
level (less than a high school degree), marital status (indicators for married,
never-married, and widowed), household size (number of members), number of cars 
owned (indicators for one car and for more than one car), an indicator for baseline 
labor force participation, and strata fixed effects. SEs are clustered at household 
level. We replace missing control values with 0 and include missing dummies for 
each. * p < 0.1 ** p < 0.05 *** p < 0.01
