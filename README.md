Description:
The code in this replication package cleans and produces the analysis files for four data sources: primary data collected by our Riyadh-based partners at Alnahda (baseline, administrative data provided by Alnahda at baseline, interim follow-up, and main follow-up) and three secondary sources (Global Findex Database 2021; Saudi Education and Training Survey 2017; and Saudi Labor Force Survey 2018). The analysis files produce the 30 tables (3 main exhibits and 27 appendix) and 5 appendix figures included in the paper, "Drivers of change: employment responses to the lifting of the Saudi female driving ban" (authors: Chaza Abou Daher, Erica Field, Kendal Swanson, and Kate Vyborny). 
Software used: Stata Version 18

Data and Data Availability Statements: 
Our primary survey data were collected by our field partners at Alnahda. Data were collected at baseline (and merged with administrative records at Alnahda), during an interim follow up, and during a main followup.
- Baseline data (which includes administrative data provided by Alnahda) can be found in "data/RCT admin and wave 1". The raw data file is "data/RCT admin and wave 1/Raw/deidentified commute dataset-20191017". An exclusion sheet (data/RCT admin and wave 1/Raw/Exclusion Sheet.xlsx) indicates baseline respondents who met inclusion/exclusion criteria and were included in the study. This Exclusion Sheet is used in the cleaning code to remove respondents not included in the study. The cleaned baseline data file is "data/RCT admin and wave 1/Final/Wave1.dta".
- Interim follow up data can be found in data/RCT wave 2. The raw data file is "data/RCT wave 2/Raw/Commute Wave 2 round 1-raw-deidentified/xlsx". The cleaned interim follow up data file is "data/RCT wave 2/Final/Wave2.dta". This file gets merged with the cleaned baseline data file; this merged version is "data/RCT wave 2/Final/Combined_waves1and2_final.dta".
- The raw data files for the main follow-up can be found in "data/RCT wave 3/Raw". The cleaned data file is merged with the cleaned data files from baseline and the interim follow up, and it is this merged file that is used in analysis. This analysis data file can be found in "data/RCT wave 3/Final/Combined_allwaves_final.dta".

Please note: Raw data files included IP addresses and neighborhoods of work and residence. We remove these in case they could be used to partially identify households. Removal of these potentially identifying variables was done manually across datasets except for the IP Addresses, which was done using <replication_code/cleaning/Anonymize IP address in link data_Wave 3.do> as the IDs were used as a measure the number of different individuals that clicked on a link to information about a leadership program (as part of the main follow up).

We also include in this replication package publicly available data that we used to generate statistics as well as figures and tables in the paper. This includes: 
- Global Findex Database 2021 (source: World Bank; found in "data/Findex Saudi/micro_sau.dta"). 
- Education and Training Survey 2017 (Source: Saudi Arabia GASTAT; found in "data/Government admin data/education_and_training_surveyen_1.xlsx")
- Labor Force Survey 2018 (source: Saudi Arabia GASTAT; found in "data/Government admin data/gastat_lfp_levels.dta").

Software requirements:
Stata (code was last run with version 18)
- swindex
- reghdfe
- ihstrans
- winsor2
- outreg2
- grc1leg
- scto
- ietoolkit
- blindschemes
- texdoc
- estout
- The program "replication_code/Master.do" will (in addition to running all data cleaning and analysis files for results in the paper) install necessary user-written packages


Controlled randomness:
- [x] Random seed is set at lines 42-43 of program "replication_code/Master.do"


Runtime and storage requirements:
- Approximate time needed to reproduce the analyses on a standard 2025 desktop machine: <10 minutes
- Approximate storage space needed: 250MB - 2GB


Description of programs/code:
- "replication_code/settings_rep_package" requires user input. This program sets globals specific to the users machine (based on the location of the rep package in their local files). The file path to the replication package must be added by user to line 18 before running any of the following programs.
- "replication_code/Master.do" will load/install all necessary Stata packages, run all cleaning and analysis programs, and run a program that generates any additional statistic reported in the paper that was not part of a table/figure.
- "replication_code/1 - Pull in data" opens the survey data used in analysis (note: this does not need to be run individually, it is called in each individual program that uses the survey data)
- "replication_code/2 - Setting regression controls" generates globals for the regression controls used in analysis for tables/figures (note: this does not need to be run individually, it is called in each individual program that uses the survey data)
- "replication_code/3 - Imputation for controls" replaces missing control values with "0" and creates a flag variable for observations with missing control values for use in analysis (note: this does not need to be run individually, it is called in each individual program that uses the survey data)
- Programs in "replication_code/cleaning" will open all raw data files, merge, and clean as needed for analysis used in this paper.
- Programs in "replication_code/figures" will generate all figures used in the online appendices of the paper
- Programs in "replication_code/tables" will generate all tables in the paper and in the online appendices
  

Instructions to replicators:
To run this replication package and generate the figures and tables found in the paper, please follow these steps:
1) Open <replication_code/settings_rep_package.do. On line 18 replace "[INSERT FILE PATH TO REP PACKAGE]" with the file path to where you have saved the <saudi_women_driving> replication package. Then run this file.
2) Open <replication_code/Master.do>. Run this file. <Master.do> will load all necessary Stata packages, load and prepare analysis ready data, and generate all figures and tables included in the paper. It will also run all robustness and statistics referred to in the paper. The run time for this file (and the accompanying do files that will run automatically as part of it) takes approximately 5 minutes.
3) Additionally, each do file in <replication_code> includes a preamble at the top describing what the code in the file does.
4) All results and log files generated from <Master.do> can be found in the results folder. Each result is saved as the figure or table number as it appears in the paper (e.g. "Tabel_1_Panel_A.tex" corresponds to Table 1, Panel A in the paper).
5) Results stored in <replication_code/tables/Robustness and stats referred to in paper> after running <replication_code/Master.do> include alternate versions of some tables as referenced in the text or table footnotes.
6) Log files from data cleaning and from the robustness section after running <replication_code/Master.do> will be saved in <results/log_files>.
